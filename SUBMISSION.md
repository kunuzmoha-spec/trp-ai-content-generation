# TRP-1 AI Content Generation – Submission

## Overview
This repository contains my work for the TRP-1 AI Content Generation challenge.
It documents my environment setup, codebase exploration, generation attempts, and reflections.

## Environment Setup
- OS: Windows
- IDE: VS Code
- Shell: PowerShell
- Reference repository (`trp1-ai-artist`) cloned successfully for exploration.
- Submission repository used exclusively for documentation and artifacts.

## Codebase Understanding
The reference project is a modular AI content generation framework built around:
- A CLI interface
- Provider abstractions for different AI services
- Pipelines for multi-step workflows
- Presets for reusable generation configurations

Detailed architecture notes are documented in `docs/CODEBASE.md`.

## Generation Status
- Generation has not started at initial submission.
- All preparation, exploration, and documentation steps are complete.
- Generation commands and outputs will be logged in `docs/GENERATION_LOG.md`.

## Challenges Encountered
- Initial confusion between reference and submission repositories.
- Repository permission restrictions (expected behavior) clarified correct workflow.

## Insights
The challenge strongly emphasizes structured thinking, documentation, and understanding
system design before execution.
