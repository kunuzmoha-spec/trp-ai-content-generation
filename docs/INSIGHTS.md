# Insights & Learnings

## Early Observations
- The challenge emphasizes process and documentation as much as final output.
- Clear separation between reference repositories and submission repositories is important.
- Understanding architecture before running commands reduces mistakes later.

## What Went Well
- Setting up the submission repository early made tracking progress easier.
- Exploring the reference codebase before execution helped clarify how the system is structured.

## What Was Challenging
- Distinguishing when to work in the reference repository versus the submission repository.
- Avoiding premature execution before fully understanding the setup steps.

## Approach Going Forward
- Proceed step by step, documenting each action.
- Focus on clarity and correctness over speed.
